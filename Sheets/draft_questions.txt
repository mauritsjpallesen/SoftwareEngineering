needs to perform?

Are there any secondary tasks the project should perform?
for example information on hover of mouse?
Expected grade depending on code tasks completed?

Give us the priority of the secondary tasks, Medium, Low?

What kind of input will we get?
where do we get the input from?

What kind of output do you expect?
File type PDF? PNG?

What interface is the user expected to use? Interactive? just in the command line? File?

Should the system be protected from making errors?
If not should the system ignore errors and move on, 
report them or stop working(Error handling)?

What kind of documentation is required?

Are there any perfomance characteristics we should 
take into consideration?
