The sequence diagram above shows the simple interaction between the DCR Graph 
visualizer and the user. It consists of the following components: The user as
the actor and the DCR Graph visualizer as the instance. The user represents a
person interacting with the visualizer which happens through the command line.
The visualizer takes as an arguement a file with the diagram explained in
proper grammar and responds with the creation of a visualized graph in .png 
form.
