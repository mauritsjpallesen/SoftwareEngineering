The statechart diagram for the event class is a diagram which accurately 
depicts all the possible states the event class can be found in and how 
exactly we can get in those states. The three variables in an event class 
are Pending/Not Pending, Included/Not Included and Executed/Not Executed. 
So with some simple math we have $2^3=8$ different possible states. 
We have decided to put as starting point the default state of a class when 
it is first created, which is Not Executed, Included and Not Pending. 
Finally we have come up with our own notation in order to properly describe 
what happens to an event when it changes state. Firstly execute() means our 
event was executed. Other() means another event was executed that had on 
it's list our event. When another event is executed it can have our event in 
it's r=response list and/or in either the e=excluded list or i=included 
list (but not both of these last two). Furthermore we have have added in our 
notation the question mark ! which denotes the absence of our event from an 
other's event particular list. For example other(!r, e) would mean that 
another event was executed which had our event on its excluded list and did 
not have our event in its response list.
