    \item \textbf{Version Control and Project Management \textbf{Git})}: Our choice here was git, git proved to be really easy for everyone to use, it is free but the most important factor of choosing it was that it actually provides us with a platform where we can have code and file version control along with a project management tool all in one.
    \item \textbf{Main implementation language \textbf{Java})}: For this project we obeyed the customer's constraints and used Java. This was done because the customer wanted the project to be easily compatibly with other Java programs. Moreover Java is a very strong language with a huge number of libraries and we believed it would be more efficient to use already existing libraries for our task.
    \item \textbf{Parser library (ANTLR)}: The choice here was made because ANTLR is a really powerful parser generator and some of the team members already had experience with it, making it an obvious choice
    \item \textbf{Visualization Library (\textbf{JGraphT})}: Of all the graph libraries we considered, \textbf{JGraphT} was the easiest to embed in our code as well as in the produced \textbf{.jar} file, such that the client machine does not need to install anything themselves.
