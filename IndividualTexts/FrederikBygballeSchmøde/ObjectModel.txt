To create the object model for our product, we used the use case scenario from the requirement elicitation to identify the needed classes, and our first iteration resulted in the diagram showed in Figure \ref{fig:objectModel}. The model is made abstract, such that the software developers have the freedom to implement any additional classes, attributes, and methods, and the model should hence be seen as a minimum set of classes to make the minimum viable product for the client. The \texttt{DCRGraph}, \texttt{Event} and \texttt{Marking} classes are provided from the handed out java engine (see Figure \ref{fig:classdiagram}), and the 3 other classes are added on behalf of the client's requirements.
